          <p>Shaders are programs that run on the GPU. There are different types of shader,
            but the ones that matter to us the most are vertex and fragment shaders.

            Vertex shaders handle the processiong of individual vertices. 
            The vertex shader will be executed roughly once for every vertex in the stream
          </p>
  
          <p>
            For each sample of the pixels covered by a primitive, a "fragment" is generated. 
            Each fragment has a Window Space position, a few other values, and it contains 
            all of the interpolated per-vertex output values from the last Vertex Processing stage.

            Random is good, 
            But also chaotic and not very  
            appealing.

          <h3 class="card-title-3">Torus</h3>
          <p>
            The first geometry we can see is known as a torus. Its geometry is part of the
            Three JS library, so it is only necesary to especify de material and create the
            mesh (geometry + material). The material is of type Points material. It means
            that instead of rendering the object in triangle list mode it is going to use
            a point list topology (draw a point per vertex).
          </p>
          <h3 class="card-title-3">Spheres</h3>
          <p>
            The spheres' geometry is also part of Three JS. We are also allowed to define
            our own materials by specifying them in a language called glsl. We needed a 
            vertex shader to modifiy the vertices of the sphere. In order to do so without
            distorting the model we used a Perlin Noise algorithm to calculate the vertices.
            To create the effect of waves we used a rotate function on the positions of the
            vertices after going through the perlin noise process. For the fragment shader
            we generated the color of each fragment based on the distortion level and a cosine
            math function.
          </p>
          <h3 class="card-title-3">3D models</h3>
          <p>
            The models were loaded in using the GLTF loader. 
            glTF is a standard file format for three-dimensional scenes and models
          </p>
          <h3 class="card-title-3">Particle system</h3>
          <p>
            The particle system is defined with a buffer geometry. This type of geometry
            allows you to define whatever primitive you want. We also used the PointsMaterial
            for this one. The positon of the vertices, in this case particles, is updated
            every frame. The program currently has 20,000 particles. They are trying to simulate 
            some kind of gravitational movement.
